## pands-problem-set
This repository contains my solutions to the Problem Sets 2019 for the Programming & Scripting module given by _Ian McLoughlin_ of GMIT.

The Problem Set itself is divided into 10 problems and this repository has a separate python program for each problem. See below for details.

## How to download this repository

1. Go to https://github.com/YBrady/pands-problem-set and download the pands-problem-set.
2. Run using python interface such as iPython.

| 2  | The program outputs whether or not today is a day that  begins with the letter T.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | problem-2.py  | No need to enter anything.                                                           |
| 3  | This program prints all numbers between 1,000 and 10,000  that are divisible by 6 but not 12.                                                                                                                                                                                                     | problem-3.py  | No need to enter anything                                                            |
| 4  | You input any positive integer and the program outputs  the successive values of the following calculation.  At each step calculate the next value by taking the  current value and, if it is even, divide it by two,  but if it is odd, multiply it by three and add one  until the result is 1. | problem-4.py  | Enter a value when prompted                                                          |
| 5  | You input a positive integer and the program tells  you if the number is a prime number or not.                                                                                                                                                                                                   | problem-5.py  | Enter a value when prompted                                                          |
| 6  | You enter a sentence and the program outputs every  second word starting from the first.                                                                                                                                                                                                          | problem-6.py  | Enter a sentence when prompted                                                       |

One using the python math library method,  one using the Newton method and a third using the  Babylonian method of approximating square roots.                                   | problem-7.py  | Enter a value when prompted                                                          |
| 8  | This program outputs today’s date and time in the  format ”Monday, January 10th 2019 at 1:15pm”.                                                                                                                                                                                                  | problem-8.py  | No input required                                                                    |
| 9  | This program reads in a text file from an argument  on the command line and outputs every second line.                                                                                                                                                                                            | problem-9.py  | There is a file1.txt file you can enter  as an argument, or pick your own text file. |
| 10 | This program displays a plot of the functions  x, x2 and 2x in the range [0, 4]                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | problem-10.py | No input required                                                                    |
